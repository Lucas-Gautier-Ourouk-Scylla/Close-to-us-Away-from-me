Combine the 2 dfs : 

```{r}
df_quest <- read.csv("questionnaire_df.csv")

df_exp <- read.csv("DF_exp.csv")

```

For the df_qest rename Participant to id_code and id to Participant

```{r}
df_quest$Participant_id <- df_quest$Participant
df_quest$Participant <- df_quest$id
```

We should be able to match EXP and QUEST DFS

```{r}
df_combined <- left_join(df_exp,df_quest, by = "Participant")
```

Write the full df 

```{r}
write.csv(df_combined, file="combined_df.csv")
```
